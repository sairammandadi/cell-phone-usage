# cell-phone-usage-report

1. Written a code to read csv files
2. Added a logic to calculate all the required details for report generation
3. Most of the time take care null check conditions, as I move on it took some time to do this so I have skipped few checks
4. After having the required details, I assumed will generate xlsx report
5. Added a logic to print report from local printer.

We can still improve the code base with much better java 8 classes usage.
